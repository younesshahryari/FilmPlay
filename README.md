### API Key Setup
To access the TMDb API, an API key is required. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. **Obtain API Key**: 
   - Visit [TMDb's API documentation](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started) to obtain your API key.

2. **Store API Key**: 
   - Add the API key to your `local.properties` file in your project directory. Include the following line:
     ```
     API_TOKEN=your_api_key_here
     ```
   Replace `your_api_key_here` with the actual key obtained from TMDb.
